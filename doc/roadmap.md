# Roadmap

## Immediate Next Steps (v1.1)

- Add schema-driven forms to improve Admin editing experience
- Support image props and asset references in JSON
- Allow drag-and-drop block ordering inside a page

## Mid-Term Goals (v2)

- Add GitHub Content API or Google Cloud Storage (GCS) as save targets
- Support per-page overrides for block props (without cloning whole blocks)
- Improve duplicate/swap block workflows in Admin UI
- Add basic validation for props (string, number, boolean, array)

## Long-Term Vision (v3+)

- Multi-user authentication & role-based access (Editors vs Admins)
- Design tokens for consistent theming across blocks
- AI-assisted editing (suggesting copy, generating block variants)
- Full Git-based content history with preview/rollback
- Page templates for faster site bootstrapping

## Goal

Demonstrate a clear growth path from a working demo to a usable CMS and, ultimately, a scalable internal platformâ€”without over-complicating the current phase.
